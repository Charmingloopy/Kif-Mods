How to add .rb mods:

The Kuray PIF Revamp offers the ability to add your own mods to the game.  To do that safely, continue reading.

As of v0.9.4 you should be seeing a Mods folder in your main directory.

download one of the mods in releases and dump it in the Mods folder.

The mods in the Mods folder are loaded from the game in alphabetical order. So if some of your mods overlap with each other,  you will need to name the one you want to overwrite the other in a way that it loads after the other one.  An easy way to do that is by numbering them. Like  01_ZeroChill.rb   02_AdvancedCasualness.rb    and so on.

If you encounter a bug in the game,  first make sure it is not one of your mods causing it.  To do that, simply  name the Mods folder something else like  "Modso". This will disable every mod in there.  If the bug still happens with the mods disabled,  the bug is appropriate to report to the kif discord.

If you encounter any bugs or errors please let me know on discord (my username is charmingloopy).
